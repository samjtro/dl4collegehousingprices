# Deep Learning for College Housing Price Forecasting
### what is this project

this is a project to fetch price histories for college housing markets, then use a deep learning algorithm to forecast future housing prices.

the purpose is twofold; first, i'm a college student going to school for ml/ai and am interested in the college housing market. second, college market rental properties are fantastic investment vehicles; being able to spot low cost properties with high rental value is a critical asset. that is precisely what this project aims to do.
