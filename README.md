### what is this project

this is a project to fetch price histories for college housing markets, then use either a PPO or a TD3 machine learning algorithm to forecast future housing prices.the purpose is twofold; first, i'm a college student going to school for ml/ai and am interested in the college housing market as i've gotten plenty of exposure to it. second, college market rental properties are fantastic investments. as a result, being able to spot low cost properties with high rental value is a critical asset. that is precisely what this project aims to do.
